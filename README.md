## Description
  A Node CLI application that creates a formatted webpage of ID cards displaying info about each member of your Engineering Team.  The cards are generated after prompts from user input are answered. They define a clear employee roster with a summary of info.  This way a manager can have quick access to employee emails and git-hub profiles for immediate contact.  

  The App was created with ES6 classes that passed all unit-testing.  The project utilizes the dependencies [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running the provided tests, and [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.

## Tests 
  This app went through much unit-testing and you can run further tests, as I did, with the command:

   `$ npm run test` 
 
  The dependency 'jest' needs to be installed as mentioned above.  I also ran this app through dozens of iterations, console.logs, validators, and nodemon.
